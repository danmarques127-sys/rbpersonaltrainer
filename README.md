<!-- ===================== MANIFESTO ===================== -->

## 🧠 Manifesto

RB Personal Trainer was **not built as a project**.  
It was built as a **system**.

Not a collection of pages.  
Not a CRUD demo.  
Not a tutorial.

This platform was designed to **run a real business**, with real users, real data, and real responsibility.

> **Software that manages people must be designed like infrastructure.**

---

<!-- ===================== WHAT PROBLEM IT SOLVES ===================== -->

## ❓ What Problem Does It Solve?

Fitness professionals often rely on:
- spreadsheets
- messaging apps
- disconnected tools
- manual follow-ups

RB Personal Trainer replaces that chaos with:

- a **single source of truth**
- structured workflows
- role-based access
- long-term data consistency

This is **business software**, not fitness hype.

---

<!-- ===================== HOW THE SYSTEM THINKS ===================== -->

## 🧩 How the Platform Thinks

RB Personal Trainer is built around **roles, permissions, and flows**.

Client → Goals → Progress → Feedback
Trainer → Plans → Monitoring → Communication
Admin → Control → Onboarding → Governance


Everything exists to support **clarity, ownership, and security**.

---

### Frontend

---

<!-- ===================== ARCHITECTURE ===================== -->

## 🧱 Architecture Philosophy

RB Personal Trainer follows a **SaaS-first architecture**:

- One core system
- Multiple role-specific interfaces
- Shared business logic
- Strict separation of concerns

core/
├─ auth
├─ config
├─ bootstrap
dashboards/
├─ client
├─ trainer
├─ admin


This allows the platform to:
- scale features
- add roles
- expose APIs
- integrate mobile apps

without rewriting foundations.
